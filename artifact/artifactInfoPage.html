    <h3>Overview:</h3>
    <textarea readonly rows="11" cols="70">
        The legendary bird Pokémon are a trio of powerful, rare 
        bird-like creatures in the Pokémon series. The original 
        trio—Articuno, Zapdos, and Moltres—come from the Kanto 
        region and are known as the winged mirages. They each
        also represent a different elemental type: Ice, Electric, 
        and Fire, respectively. Variants of these birds, known as
        the Galarian forms, exist in the Galar region, featuring 
        different typings and abilities. These Pokémon are often 
        associated with myths and legends, making them popular 
        and highly sought after by trainers.

    <h3>Articuno's Story:</h3>
    <textarea readonly rows="8" cols="70">
        Articuno is an Ice/Flying-type Legendary Pokémon known 
        as the "Freezing Pokémon." It is said to appear before 
        lost travelers in icy regions, guiding them to safety. 
        Articuno is often found in remote, cold locations like 
        the Seafoam Islands in Kanto. In Galar, a Galarian form
        exists, which is a Psychic/Flying-type with a more 
        aggressive nature.

    <h3>Zapdos's Story:</h3>
    <textarea readonly rows="8" cols="70">
        Zapdos is an Electric/Flying-type Legendary Pokémon known 
        as the "Electric Pokémon." It is said to appear during 
        thunderstorms, drawing power from lightning to strengthen 
        itself. Zapdos is often found in isolated locations like 
        the Power Plant in Kanto. In Galar, its Galarian form is a 
        Fighting/Flying-type, resembling a fast, powerful runner 
        rather than a lightning wielder.

    <h3>Moltres's Story:</h3>
    <textarea readonly rows="7" cols="70">
        Moltres is a Fire/Flying-type Legendary Pokémon known as 
        the "Flame Pokémon." It is said to bring the arrival of 
        spring by spreading embers as it flies. Moltres is often 
        found in volcanic or remote areas like Victory Road in Kanto. 
        In Galar, its Galarian form is a Dark/Flying-type, with an 
        aura of fiery malice that drains the will of its opponents.
